# Library and E-commerce API - Swagger Editor

This project focuses on designing your API endpoints for the models in the Library or E-commerce domains. The API endpoints should be documented using Swagger for clear and consistent documentation.

This assignment is an introduction to how to document a very basic API

## Level 1: Basic Requirements

In this level, the following tasks need to be completed:

- Define the models for the Library or E-commerce domains.
- Design the endpoints for basic CRUD operations for each model.

## Level 2: Additional Requirements

In addition to the basic requirements, the following tasks should be implemented:
- Define the relations among the models to establish the necessary connections.
- Design endpoints for user authentication, including login, register, and logout functionality.
- Design endpoints for searching products by name.
- Design endpoints for pagination and sorting to efficiently retrieve data.




`Please note that the additional requirements are optional and can be completed if you have additional time and advanced skills.`
